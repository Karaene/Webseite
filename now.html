FULLDIVE
A FullDive (フルダイブ, FuruDaibu?) is the act during which one uses technology 
to fully immerse one's consciousness in a virtual reality. Developed by Kayaba Akihiko, 
the technology led to the creation of the device NerveGear. It is the basis of most of 
the stories in the entire Sword Art Onlineseries. 


NERVEGEAR
The «NerveGear» (ナーヴギア, Nāvugia?) is a 2nd generation FullDive machine that was created 
by Argus. It only has a single interface that covers a player's whole head and face. 
It completely controls the player's consciousness by redirecting the signals the brain sends 
to the body and sending its own waves to stimulate the five senses. It has its own battery 
source, as well as a high frequency electromagnetic microwaves transmitter. Puzzles, education 
related games, or environmental type games were first produced for NerveGear. Therefore, 
Sword Art Online was a major excitement to all gamers. This design trapped 10,000 players 
during the official launch of Sword Art Online in September 2022. It is the first VR 
technology that has been mass-produced.
 
Transceivers
The NerveGear's high-density microwave transceivers are capable of accessing the user's brain, 
allowing it to send fake signals to the five senses of the user.[4] 
The transceivers are not only capable of inducing fake sensory signals but can also block every
movement command from the brain to the body, preventing the player from moving their body while
in FullDive to avoid injuries.[4] The transceivers are also capable of blocking sensory 
information from the body to the brain, thus, while using it, the player is completely 
insensate to the physical world.[citation needed] The NerveGear is able to destroy a person's 
brain by emitting high-powered microwaves, shutting down one's vital processes, and Sword Art 
Online's (SAO) operating system has been programmed to do so if the player's Hit Points are 
reduced to zero.[3] Despite the exact method that kills a player being disclosed in the story, 
some of the signs left behind in the brain are cerebral hemorrhaging and arterial occlusion.[5] 
The NerveGear is equipped with a new generation diamond semiconductor central processor.

After the events of the Death Game incident, Argus no longer produced new NerveGear units, and 
most users instead used RECT's replacement for the system - the AmuSphere, which has 
significantly less powerful transceivers; it is thus incapable of doing harm to a player, but 
cannot completely eliminate normal sensory input.

The NerveGear's high-density microwave transceivers can determine what the user's face looks like.

AMUSPHERE
The «AmuSphere» (アミュスフィア, Amyusufia?) is a 2nd[1] generation FullDive machine, which was 
co-developed by RECT Progress Inc.. The system has been modified to make it safer than its 
predecessor by changing the microwave transmitter to a low frequency one. The AmuSphere's 
design incorporates various sensors that continually monitor blood pressure and brain waves 
and provoke a safety logout feature in case that the person's status becomes abnormal. 
In addition, the AmuSphere does not completely block out signals from the body, like NerveGear
did, so some players may pay extra for specialized rooms designed to make the experience 
in the virtual world more real by excluding the sounds and sensations from the outside.

The system has been modified to make it safer than its predecessor by changing the microwave 
transmitter to a low-frequency one and the incorporation of various sensors that continually 
monitor blood pressure and brain waves.[citation needed] If the person's condition becomes 
abnormal, a safety logout is provoked.[4] This, by default, includes an option that 
automatically logs out a person if the avatar begins to fall asleep.[5] Unlike the 
NerveGear, the AmuSphere is not equipped with an internal battery.[6]

In addition to other safety measures, the AmuSphere does not block out signals from the body
to the extent of its predecessor, the NerveGear, so some players may rent a specialized room
which blocks all external interference, designed to make the experience inside the virtual
world all the more realistic.
 
 
To use NerveGear and AmuSphere, the player places the game console over the head. They will 
then plug an internet cable connected to the console into the wall. Then, the player will lay 
down in a comfortable position, usually in a bed. Afterwards, the helmet-like console will 
activate through the initiation words «Link Start» and will begin loading the currently 
inserted game. 
 
 The «Soul Translator» (ソウル・トランスレーター, Sōru Toransurētā?, abbreviated as STL) is a 4th 
 generation FullDive machine invented by Higa Takeru at Rath. Unlike its predecessors, 
 the machine connects to a human's Fluctlight (i.e. consciousness or soul), instead of the 
 brain. As of July 5, 2026, there are 5 STLs in existence: 1 is at Rath's main office in 
 Roppongi and the other 4 are at the Ocean Turtle.
